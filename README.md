# AR_Accounts_Prediction_xgboost

My team created an xgboost model using over 300 variables. The goal was to predict the pay rate of invoices, giving the company insight into which accounts would potentially be late on payment. The dataset was given to us by the client. We calculated a new variable, age, as the target variable for our model. The code includes visualization plots of the data, as well as residuals plot and ecdf plot for the results. Our model was able to predict rate of invoice payment within 2 weeks for 90% of accounts.
